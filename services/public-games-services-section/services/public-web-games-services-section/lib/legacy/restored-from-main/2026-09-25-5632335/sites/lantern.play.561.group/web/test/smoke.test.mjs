/**
 * `smoke` — face-spec item 7's required smoke test: "simulate 30 days of reviews via the
 * engine (injected timestamps) asserting territory grows then partially fogs on lapse."
 *
 * Drives the REAL engine (the education platform's `srs` and `lightcone`), not the browser ports, against
 * the real compiled wing-one world (`data/world-weiqi.json`) — this is a behavioral check of
 * the engine's own light-cone/territory contract as the face relies on it, not a UI test.
 * Every `now` is an injected integer day (never `Date.now()`), matching the engine's own
 * determinism contract.
 *
 * Scenario: an "active" player gates every newly-reachable room, one single pass per day, for
 * the first 10 days (days 0-9), self-grading each gate-pass "Good" (S0 = 2.5 days — a normal
 * grade, not cherry-picked to be fragile). The dense wing-one door graph (~8 average degree
 * over 37 rooms) means this reaches full territory within the first few days — the light cone
 * doesn't drip open one room at a time, it floods, and that's a real property of THIS corpus's
 * graph, not a simulation artifact. The player then goes quiet for the rest of the window
 * (days 10-29): no further reviews at all, only time passing. Because nothing was reviewed a
 * second time, every card's stability stays at its single-review S0 = 2.5 days, so by day 29
 * (24-29 days after last review) essentially everything has decayed out of full/embers —
 * demonstrating fog at scale, not just at the margins. Asserted:
 *
 *   1. Revealed territory is monotonic — it never shrinks on any day, active or lapsed.
 *   2. The active phase actually grows the light cone beyond the wing's two always-open root
 *      rooms (proves the gate→light-cone→new-doors loop is really running, not stalled), and
 *      does so before the final day (a genuine earlier peak, not a coincidence at the end).
 *   3. By day 29, a FRESH light-cone computation finds fewer reachable rooms than that peak —
 *      doors beyond now-dim/fogged rooms drop out of the light cone, even though nothing was
 *      ever deleted from the world.
 *   4. Revealed territory at day 29 still exceeds day 29's reachable set — the fogged rooms
 *      are unreachable, not erased; their card/door data is untouched.
