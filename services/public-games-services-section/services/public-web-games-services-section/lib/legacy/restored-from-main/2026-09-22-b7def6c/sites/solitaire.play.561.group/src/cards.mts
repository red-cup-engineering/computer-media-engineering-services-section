/**
 * `cards` — the deck: suits, ranks, deterministic seeded shuffling.
 *
 * The RNG here is the same string-hash + mulberry32 approach `flickering-delve-service/src/seed.mts`
 * already uses for its procedural cave (see solitaire's DESIGN.md, "Deterministic seeded deals") —
 * no new randomness idea needed, just applied to a shuffled deck instead of a dungeon layout.
 * `hashSeed`/`rngFrom` below now compose the house `@red-cup-engineering/seeded-random`
 * primitive (FNV-1a fold + mulberry32) directly rather than holding a local re-derivation, so a
 * seed string produces the *identical* card order on any machine, any process, forever — the
 * property that makes `?seed=` URLs and the daily deal work at all. `@red-cup-engineering/card-table`
 * (see its README's "Provenance" note) already extracted this exact deck/shuffle construction
 * from this module; this file supplies the same construction seeded-random's canonical way.
 *
 * Nothing in this module touches the clock or any mutable module-level state: every export is a
 * pure function over its arguments, and `shuffle` never mutates its input array.
