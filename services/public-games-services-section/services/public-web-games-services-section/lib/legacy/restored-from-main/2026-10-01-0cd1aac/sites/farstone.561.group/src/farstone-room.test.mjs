// farstone-room.test — the qwzspace room wiring: presence.join maps to the SAME persisted feltos
// actor mud.connect() would give a JSON `/connect` caller (not an eviction on leave), commands flow
// through gameValidate -> mud.enqueue() -> mud.tick() exactly once per runTick, per-actor perception
// frames render through snapOf, and — the determinism claim this file's own header makes ("meaningful
// for a room instance never driven by an explicit /tick call outside its own stepOnce()") — qwzspace's
// own `verify()` (a from-tick-0 replay through an INDEPENDENT worldFactory instance) matches the live
// room's state hash after a real session of mixed commands across several ticks, when the room alone
// (never the raw HTTP /tick route) drives the engine. Mirrors tidepool-room.test.mts's own shape.
