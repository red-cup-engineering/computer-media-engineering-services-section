// farstone-room — qwzspace's `world: worldFactory` seam (room.mjs), Farstone's counterpart to
// Tidepool's own `tidepool-room.mts` (tidepool-services-section sibling) — but wired to Farstone's
// EXISTING `MudServer` (mud-server.mjs), not a parallel join/submit/step chain of this file's own.
//
// WHY THIS DIVERGES FROM TIDEPOOL'S OWN WIRING, DELIBERATELY: Tidepool has no pre-existing HTTP API,
// so its room wires qwzspace straight to feltos's `createEngine`/`join`/`submit`/`step` (its own
// header explains why: never `MudServer`, "which would just duplicate what qwzspace's room already
// does"). Farstone is the opposite situation — it ALREADY ships a JSON request/response API
// (world-hosting's http-wiring / serve.mts) built on ONE raw, synchronous `MudServer` instance that headless
// clients and wheatstone depend on, unchanged, per this feature's own requirement. Introducing a
// SECOND, independently-stepped feltos engine for the WS transport would fork the world in two —
// exactly the single-source-of-truth failure this design avoids. So: `worldFactory()` here
// constructs a fresh `MudServer` (from the SAME immutable `bootEngine` every call — feltos engines
// are immutable/frozen, so replaying the same intent sequence against independently-constructed
// MudServer instances seeded from the same snapshot is exactly as safe as Tidepool's own
// join/submit/step replay; see that file's header for the identical reasoning), and the FIRST
// (live) instance's MudServer becomes the ONE object BOTH transports drive: this file's own
// `runTick` routes WS intents into `mud.connect()`/`mud.enqueue()`/`mud.tick()` — the exact same
// methods the JSON `/connect`, `/command`, and `/tick` routes already call — and `serve.mts` hands
// that SAME live instance to `createWorldHttpServer`, completely unchanged.
//
// "runTick calls the feltos engine's step": `mud.tick()` (mud-server.mjs) calls engine.mjs's own
// `step()` internally — one `MudServer.tick()` per `runTick`, "qwzspace's tick literally IS feltos's
// tick" one level of indirection through the object Farstone's HTTP API already trusts.
//
// TWO IDENTITY SPACES, deliberately kept distinct — exactly as tidepool-room.mts documents (same
// reasoning applies verbatim here):
//   - the qwzspace-level actorId (room.mjs's own `"a" + randomBytes(6).hex()`, one per LIVE
//     connection) — qwzspace's entity-cache key AND the id a client's `view.myId()` adopts from
//     `hello`. Tier-1 (resume-token) reconnection is entirely qwzspace's own mechanism, keyed on
//     THIS id.
//   - the feltos actor id (`actorIdFor(name)`, mud-server.mjs — a deterministic
//     `sha256(normalized-name)` slug) — the PERSISTED body: location, inventory, standing, coin.
//     `mud.connect(name)` resolves to this id; two different qwzspace connections presenting the
//     same display name resolve to the SAME feltos actor (Tier-2 identity), because `join()`
//     (engine.mjs, called internally by `MudServer.connect`) is a documented no-op when the actor
//     already exists.
//
// `bodyOf` (below) is the live map from the first identity space to the second, held in ONE
// worldFactory() call's closure — never shared across independent instances.
//
// HONEST, DISCLOSED LIMITATION (a genuine cost of the divergence above, named plainly rather than
// hidden): because the explicit `POST /tick` HTTP route continues to call `mud.tick()` directly
// (unchanged, per the "HTTP API MUST keep working unchanged" requirement) — a mutation this room's
// own qwzspace intent log never records — qwzspace's own `room.verify()`/self-audit (replay-from-log
// vs. live state hash) is only meaningful for a room instance that has NEVER been driven by an
// explicit `/tick` call outside its own `stepOnce()`/`runTick()`. This is true of every test in
// farstone-room.test.mts (which never exercises the HTTP layer in the same process) and NOT
// guaranteed true of a live, mixed-transport deployment where both `/tick` and WS traffic hit the
// same instance — `selfAuditEvery` stays 0 here for exactly this reason (never wired to run
// automatically in `createFarstoneRoom`), matching Tidepool's own default and its own stated
// rationale ("a correctness dial, not required for v1 durability, which rests entirely on FeltOS's
// own bucket-persisted trace" — true here too: Farstone's durability rests on world-hosting's world-store's
// engine snapshot, not on qwzspace's log-replay).
