 * listenFarstoneTelnet — wire feltos's telnet transport onto `mud` (the SAME live MudServer

 * path — one clock, never a second independent setInterval driving the ENGINE (serve.mts's own
 * stated design; see world-hosting's world-runtime's header). feltos's `tickMudTelnetServer` bundles "tick
 * the engine" with "push connected sessions' output" in one call and exposes no push-only
 * counterpart nor an injectable tick function (a feltos-side gap, filed not fixed — a parallel
 * lot owns feltos): this function works around it by handing `createMudTelnetServer` a thin
 * wrapper whose `.tick()` is a no-op and whose other methods pass straight through to `mud` —
 * same world, same actors, same state, tick ownership subtracted out. Callers drive the actual
 * push half via `pushFarstoneTelnetUpdates`, from `runtime`'s own `onCatchUp` hook.
 *
 * A second feltos-side gap (also filed, not fixed): `createMudTelnetServer`'s `MudServer`-shaped
 * interface requires fully SYNCHRONOUS `connect`/`enqueue` (telnet.mjs's own `handleLine` never
 * awaits them), unlike world-hosting's http-wiring's composition (which wraps http.mjs's request listener
 * from OUTSIDE and awaits `preRequestCatchUp()` before it runs). Telnet has no equivalent
 * request/response boundary to interpose an async catch-up on, so a fresh `connect()` here can
 * only flush afterward fire-and-forget (below), not block the line on catch-up first — the
 * steady `catchUpIntervalMs` timer is what keeps telnet's view of the world moving instead.
 *
 * Defaults to port 4242, override via `opts.port` exactly like `PORT` overrides the HTTP port.
